# Traffic-Sign Recognition and Classification
## ME499 - Independent Project, Winter 2021
Yael Ben Shalom, Northwestern University.


## Project Overview
This project contains 2 modules:
1. [**Traffic signs classification**](https://github.com/YaelBenShalom/Traffic-Sign-Recognition-and-Classification/tree/master/classification) - In this module I built and trained a neural network to classify different traffic signs using PyTorch.
2. [**Traffic signs recognition**](https://github.com/YaelBenShalom/Traffic-Sign-Recognition-and-Classification/tree/master/recognition) - In this module I built and trained a neural network to detect and classify different traffic signs using Faster-R-CNN.
