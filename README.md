# Traffic-Sign Recognition and Classification
## ME499 - Independent Project, Winter 2021
Yael Ben Shalom, Northwestern University


## Project Overview
This project contains 2 parts:
1. **Traffic signs classification** - In this part I built and trained a neural network to classify different traffic signs using PyTorch.
2. **Traffic signs recognision** - In this part I built and trained a neural network to detect and classify different traffic signs using Faster-R-CNN.
