# Traffic-Sign Recognition and Classification
## ME499 - Independent Project, Winter 2021
Yael Ben Shalom, Northwestern University.


## Project Overview
This project contains 2 modules:
1. [**Traffic sign detection and classification**]https://github.com/YaelBenShalom/Objects-Recognition-and-Classification/tree/master/traffic_signs_detection) - In this module I built and trained a neural network to detect and classify different traffic signs using PyTorch, OpenCV and YoloV3.<br>
This module contained 2 parts:
    * [traffic sign classification](https://github.com/YaelBenShalom/Objects-Recognition-and-Classification/tree/master/traffic_signs_detection/traffic_signs_classification) - Were I build and trained a neural network to classify different traffic-signs images.
    * [traffic sign detection](https://github.com/YaelBenShalom/Objects-Recognition-and-Classification/tree/master/traffic_signs_detection/traffic_signs_recognition) - Were I trained neural network to detect different traffic-signs in an image/video.

    An example of traffic detection program output:<br>

2. [**Trash detection, classification and segmentation**](https://github.com/YaelBenShalom/Objects-Recognition-and-Classification/tree/master/trash_detection) - In this module I built and trained a neural network to detect and classify different traffic signs using PyTorch, OpenCV and YoloV5.<br>
This module contained 2 parts:
    * [trash classification](https://github.com/YaelBenShalom/Objects-Recognition-and-Classification/tree/master/traffic_signs_detection/traffic_signs_classification) - Were I build and trained a neural network to classify different recycable objects' images.
    * [trash detection](https://github.com/YaelBenShalom/Objects-Recognition-and-Classification/tree/master/traffic_signs_detection/traffic_signs_recognition) - Were I trained neural network to detect different recycable objects in an image/video.

    As an additional development of the [Recycler Baxter](https://github.com/YaelBenShalom/Recycler-Baxter) project, I used the ML algorithm I implemented in this project to detect and locate the recycable objects sorted by the baxter robot:
