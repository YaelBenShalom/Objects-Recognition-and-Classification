## Module Overview
In this module I built and trained a neural network to classify different traffic signs using PyTorch.<br>
I based my program on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark ([GTSRB](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html)) dataset.


## User Guide
### Program Installation

1. Clone the repository, using the following commands:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/YaelBenShalom/Objects-Recognition-and-Classification/tree/master/traffic_signs_detection/traffic_signs_classification
    ```

2. Download the dataset and extract it into `./data` directory. The dataset can be found on the [INI Benchmark website](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news), or downloaded directly through [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic-signs-data.zip).


### Quickstart Guide

Run the classification program:
1. To train and test the program on the dataset, run the following command from the root directory:
    ```
    python code/classification.py
    ```

2. To train the program on the dataset and test it on a specific image, copy the image to the root directory and run the following command from the root directory:
    ```
    python code/classification.py --image <image-name>
    ```
    Where `<image-name>` is the name of the image (including image type).<br>
    The trained model will be saved in the root directory as `/model`.

3. To to use an existing model and test it on a specific image, copy the image to the root directory and run the following command from the root directory:
    ```
    python code/classification.py --image <image-name> --model <model-name>
    ```
    Where `<model-name>` is the name of the trained model.

## Dataset

The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark ([GTSRB](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html)) is a large multi-category classification benchmark. It was used in a competition at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011.

The benchmark has the following properties:
1. Single-image, multi-class classification problem.
2. 43 classes.
3. More than 50,000 images in total (~35,000 training images, ~4000 validation images, and ~13,000 testing images).
4. Large, lifelike database.

The dataset can be found on the [INI Benchmark website](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news), or downloaded directly through [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic-signs-data.zip).
